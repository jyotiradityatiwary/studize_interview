# Development Hints  üñ•Ô∏è

## Filesystem structure

```
lib                    <-- All the dart code goes here
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.dart          <-- Starting point of the app
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screens            <-- This contains the indivisual UI screens
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ home_page.dart
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ widgets            <-- This contains the reusable widgets
    ‚îÇ                      used elsewhere in the code
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ date_picker.dart
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

**Tip:** Using `Ctrl+click` in VSCode to navigate to definitions of different classes in functions is easier than looking up the filesystem manually instead.
